# Card Deck Simulation

This project simulates a simple card deck and deals cards to 4 players in a fixed order. It does not shuffle the deck and deals cards according to specific rules outlined in the code.

## Features:
- A deck of 52 playing cards is created (with suits and ranks).
- Cards are dealt to 4 players in a set sequence.
- After dealing the cards, each player's hand is displayed.

## How It Works:
1. The deck is created with 52 cards, consisting of 4 suits (`Hearts`, `Diamonds`, `Clubs`, `Spades`) and 13 ranks (`2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `J`, `Q`, `K`, `A`).
2. Cards are dealt to 4 players in 2 rounds, each receiving 2 cards. Players 2 and 3 are given an additional card.
3. The program prints each player's hand, showing the cards they received.

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a C# IDE like Visual Studio.
2. Run the program to simulate the card dealing process.
